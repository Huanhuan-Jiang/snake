# Snake Game Project

This project is a Snake game developed using C++ and the SDL library. It was created to enhance my skills in C++ programming, utilizing the SDL library for game development, and managing projects on GitHub.

## Features

- **Custom dequeofunique Library**: I designed a `dequeofunique` library to manage the snake's body data using `deque` and `unordered_set` to ensure the validity of the snake's body.
- **SDL Wrapper**: Since SDL is written in C, I wrapped the SDL functions in C++ within a custom-designed `sdl` library.
- **Testing**: I utilized GoogleTest to test the game's functions thoroughly.
- **Continuous Integration**: I implemented CI pipelines to run `clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, and GoogleTest on my code upon each push to GitHub.
- **Professional Code Organization**: The project follows professional style guidelines for code organization and management on GitHub.

## Project Structure

- **snakesrc**: Contains the code related to the snake's functionality.
- **gamesrc**: Contains the code related to the game's interface.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
